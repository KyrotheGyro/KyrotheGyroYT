### About Me

My name is Kyro (pronounced kee-roh) and I am currently a sophomore in high school. I play euphonium, trombone, and piano. I like all things music: listening to it, playing it, and making it. I also enjoy playing sports. My favorite sports to play are water polo, basketball, and swimming.
